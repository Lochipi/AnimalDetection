# Animal Detection and Classification in Images

This repository presents a deep learning-based solution for animal detection and classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our aim is to automatically identify and classify animals using the Animals Detection Images Dataset. The solution employs powerful object detection and classification techniques to provide efficient and accurate results.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage deep learning algorithms and CNNs to identify and categorize animals in images. The model can recognize a variety of animals and classify them accurately. By automating the process of animal recognition and classification, we aim to assist researchers, wildlife organizations, and nature enthusiasts in their respective endeavors.

## Dataset

We utilize the [Animals Detection Images Dataset](<link to the dataset>) for this project. The dataset consists of a diverse collection of animal images, including various species along with their class labels. The dataset is divided into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of our CNN-based model objectively.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: I preprocess the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and performing data augmentation to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Architecture**: Our model uses a CNN architecture designed for object detection and classification tasks. It comprises convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers with appropriate activation functions.

3. **Training**: I have trained the model using the preprocessed training dataset, employing suitable optimization algorithms and performance metrics to ensure convergence and high accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**: I have evaluated the performance of the trained model on the test dataset and report relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, I deploy it for real-world animal detection and classification tasks.
